                <p>The web development ecosystem has evolved significantly over the past few years. As we move through 2024, several trends and technologies are shaping how we build for the web.</p>

                <h2>Performance-First Development</h2>
                <p>Performance is no longer an afterthought. With Core Web Vitals becoming ranking factors and users expecting instant loading times, developers are prioritizing performance from the start of their projects.</p>

                <h2>The Rise of Modern CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS has matured significantly with features like Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties. These tools allow us to create complex layouts with less code and better maintainability.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript Frameworks and Tools</h2>
                <p>While React, Vue, and Angular continue to dominate, newer frameworks like Svelte and Solid.js are gaining traction for their performance benefits and developer experience.</p>

                <h2>Build Tools and Bundlers</h2>
                <p>Vite, esbuild, and other modern build tools are making development faster and more efficient. The focus is on speed and developer experience.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The key to successful web development in 2024 is staying adaptable and focusing on user experience. Whether you're using the latest frameworks or vanilla JavaScript, the goal remains the same: create fast, accessible, and maintainable web applications.</p>
